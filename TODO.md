- [ ] Now, test inside Grasshopper
- [ ] Fix bundle regression based on https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/248154
- [ ] Then, find the old Grasshopper definition for the panels. Extract the panel meshes and the relative transformations
- [ ] Set it up to align the sheet of paper bundle with the world frame
- [ ] Align lowest numerical panel to its intended location
- [ ] Get measurements on the other panels (using that thingy method) to detect the difference between the intended and placed
- [ ] Add additional panel?
- [ ] PCL data? As an afterthought perhaps
